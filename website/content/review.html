</p>
<p>
  You can design the structure of the RDF data by creating an RDF Transform template. Then, using the
  Export menu's RDF Transform exports, the exporter iterates through the project rows or records
  evaluating expressions in the RDF Transform and producing an equivalent RDF subgraph for each row or
  record. The final result is a single file containing all the subgraphs.<br />
  All known RDF4J formats are listed in the "Export" menu.
</p>
<p>
  The image below shows the main parts of a sample RDF Template.

<p class="note">
  Any applied filters on the data affect the exported RDF (i.e., exported RDF data corresponds to the
  current visible rows or records). This feature processes RDF data with any custom subset of the data or
  by using different transforms for different subsets of the data.
</p>
<p>
  You can define multiple subject resources (i.e., multiple root nodes) as shown in the figure
  above...and delete them if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Terms from existing vocabularies can be imported. The "Add" namespace feature provides a vocabulary importer
  that can attempt to retrieve and index the vocabulary terms so that they can be included as autocompletion
  entries available for class (type) and property additions. Also, by using a dump from a namespace lookup
  site, for example <a href="http://prefix.cc">prefix.cc</a>, IRIs for popular namespaces are automatically
  suggested.
</p>
<p>
  With the "Import Template" functionality, you can recall a template previous exported via the "Export Template"
  function.
  BEWARE: Importing a template adds the template content to the existing Transform workspace.  Delete all your
  Root Nodes if you want to replace the current template.
</p>
<p>
  With the "Export Template" functionality, you can export a JSON file containing the RDF Transform.  The format
  is fairly self explaining with readable key:value pairs. You can use exported templates to either process same
  structure projects or jump start a similar project using the "Import Template" function.
