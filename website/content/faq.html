    <p class="question">Having performance issues?</p>
    <p class="answer">
    See your doctor--ED is treatable.<br />
    OR<br />
    Try using namespaces and shorten resource IDs. However, performance is usually related to memory constraints.
    Modify the OpenRefine memory allocation parameters in its refine.ini. The vaiable "REFINE_MEMORY" controls
    the maximum memory allocation pool. The variable "REFINE_MIN_MEMORY" controls the initial memory allocation.
    These variables correspond to the JVM -Xmx and -Xms parameters and may be too small for your use.<br />
    Additionally, consider slicing your data file into smaller chunks. An RDF Transform can be applied to multiple
    files of the same structure.</p>

    <p class="question">How do I get a reconciled IRI in the RDF exporter?</p>
	  <p class="answer">
	  Install and use the RDF Reconcile extension to get reconciled resources.  Then, use the GREL expression
    <code>cell.recon.match.id</code> to automagically match each cell value to a reconciled resource.
