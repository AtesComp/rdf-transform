    <p class="question">Having performance issues?</p>
    <p class="answer">
      See your doctor--ED is treatable.<br />
      OR<br />
      Try using namespaces and shorten resource IDs. However, performance is usually related to memory constraints.
      Modify the OpenRefine memory allocation parameters in its refine.ini. The variable "REFINE_MEMORY" controls
      the maximum memory allocation pool. The variable "REFINE_MIN_MEMORY" controls the initial memory allocation.
      These variables correspond to the JVM -Xmx and -Xms parameters. The defaults may be too small for your use.<br />
      Additionally, consider slicing your data file into smaller chunks. An RDF Transform can be applied to multiple
      files of the same structure:<br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Export the RDF Transform from the first file's work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Importing the RDF Transform for the successive files.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <p class="question">
      A SPARQL endpoint is not responding the way I want!<br />
      A SPARQL endpoint doesn't have text searching!</p>
      <p class="answer">Try using a DESCRIBE query on a known resource.</p>

    <p class="question">How do I get a reconciled IRI in the RDF exporter?</p>
	  <p class="answer">
	  Use OpenRefine's Reconciliation functions.  Then, use the GREL expression <code>cell.recon.match.id</code> to automagically match each cell value to a reconciled
    resource.
