  The RDF Tranform can be exported as a JSON template. The JSON structure is use internally
  to manage the RDF Transform elements. The JSON structure is shown below. This structure is
  further dissected and discussed.

        ...
    ],
    "version" : "(some version id)"
 }
</pre>
<h2>Header...</h2>
<p>
  The Header section consists of the following:
</p>
<pre>
{
    "baseIRI" : "some://Example/iri",
    "extension" : "RDFTransform",
    "namespaces" : {
        "(prefix)" : "some://Example/namespace/",
        ...
    },
    ...
    "version" : "(some version id)"
}
</pre>
<p>
  The various Header elements are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The "baseIRI" key describes the default namespace when a prefix is not given.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "extension" key identifies the RDF Transform extension as the generating
      origin.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "namespace" key describes a container of key:values pairs for the embedded
      namespaces where the key is the short prefix identifier and the value is the
      related IRI namespace.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "version" key is the extension version used to generate the JSON.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>Triple Template...</h2>
<p>
  The template is a mapping used to process triples from the data and contains elements
  that match up to the triple components: subject, property, and object.  The initial
  subjects are found in the Triple Mapping section designated by the "subjectMappings"
  key. The "subjectMappings" key holds a list of subject maps.  The properties are
  found in each subject map designated by the "propertyMappings" key. The
  "propertyMappings" key holds a list of property maps. The objects are
  found in each property map designated by the "objectMappings" key. The
  "objectMappings" key holds a list of object maps.  An object map may, in turn, be
  a subject for another triple holding its own "propertyMappings" key and so on.
</p>
<h3>Triple Mapping...</h3>
<p>
  The Triple Mapping section consists of the following:
</p>
<pre>
    "subjectMappings" : [
        {
            ...
            "propertyMappings" : [
                {
                    ...
                    "objectMappings" : [
                        {
                            ...
                        },
                        ...
                    ],
                    ...
                },
                ...
            ],
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
</pre>
<p>
  The "subjectMappings" key describes a list of Root Node subject (resource) maps that
  start a triple expression. The "propertyMappings" key describes a list of property
  (resource) maps. The "objectMappings" key describes a list of object (resource or
  literal) maps.
</p>
<p class="note">
  An incomplete Triple Mapping section may exist with only partially complete triple
  maps as the JSON represents the work in the Transform Tab which may be a
  work-in-progress.
</p>
<h2>Subject and Object Maps...</h2>
<p>
  The subject and object maps have a similar structure for resource and literal mapping:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    {
        "expression" : {
            "code" : "(some expression code)",
            "language" : "grel"
        },
        "prefix" : "(some prefix value)",
        "propertyMappings" : [
            ...
        ],
        "typeMappings" : [
            ...
        ],
        "valueSource" : {
            ...
        },
        "valueType" : {
            ...
        }
    }.
    ...
</pre>
<p>
  The various resource and literal mapping elements are:
  <ol>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "expression" key describes the expression container. Expressions are used
      to calculate some result that can be used as a resource or literal. The expression
      container holds a "code" key that has the coding language statements as its value.
      It also holds a "language" key that has the coding language value. Currently, GREL
      ("grel") is the only coding language recognized. Resources and literals have a
      default expression as the source "value" (see "valueSource" below).
    </li>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "prefix" key identifies the prefixed namespace used for an IRI and is appended
      to the Local Part of the IRI to form a Condensed IRI Expression (CIRIE). Resources
      may have prefixes. Literals do not have prefixes.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "propertyMappings" key describes the list of property maps as discussed
      previously.
    </li>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "typeMappings" key describes a specialized list of type maps. Type maps always
      use an "rdf:type" (or "a") property with the given type information as the object
      to produce "type" triples for a resource. The "typeMappings" key is discussed in
      more detail later.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "valueSource" key describes the node's source information for a resource or
      literal and is discussed in more detail later.
    </li>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "valueType" key describes the node's type information for a resource or literal
      and is discussed in more detail later.<br />
      For <b>Root Node subject maps</b>, the "valueType" key section is optional as all
      Root Nodes subjects are always resource IRIs and, therefore, have a default "iri"
      type value. Root Nodes subject maps may also be specified as Blank Nodes. For
      object maps, objects may be either resources or literals.  Then, the "valueType"
      key section is used to designate resource or literal type values.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>Property Maps...</h2>
<p>
  The property maps have a reduced structure for resource mapping:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    {
        "objectMappings" : [
            ...
        ]
        "prefix" : "(prefix)",
        "valueSource" : {
            ...
        },
    }.
    ...
</pre>
<p>
  Since all properties are resource IRIs, the "valueType" key is not needed.
  Additionally, the "valueSource" key currently always specifies a constant resource.
  Then, the "expression" key is also not needed.
</p>
<p class="note">
  As properties are not normally typed, the "typeMappings" key is not needed. To type a
  property, create a new Root Node designed to be equal to the property IRI and use the
  "Add type..." feature or designate a "rdf:type" property map and an object map to use
  as the type.
</p>
<p>
  The various property mapping elements are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The "objectMappings" key describes the list of object maps as discussed previously.
    </li>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "prefix" key identifies the prefixed namespace used for an IRI as discussed
      previously. It is harvested from the source information if present.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "valueSource" key describes the property's source information for a resource.
      It currently always specifies a constant resource and is discussed in more detail
      later.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>Type Maps...</h2>
<p>
  The type maps have a reduced structure for resource mapping:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    {
        "prefix" : "(prefix)",
        "valueSource" : {
            "constant" : "(IRI Local Part)",
            "source" : "constant"
        }
    },
    {
        "valueSource" : {
            "constant" : "(Full IRI)",
            "source" : "constant"
        }
    },
    ...
</pre>
<p>
  A type map currently always specifies a constant resource. The constant resource may be
  a prefixed IRI (a CIRIE) or a fully specified IRI. If prefixed, the prefix is harvested
  from the constant and mapped in the JSON structure.  If there is no suitable prefix,
  the "prefix" key is not used and the constant remains as entered.
</p>
<p>
  The various type mapping elements are:
  <ol>
    <li><b>OPTIONAL</b>
      The "prefix" key identifies the prefixed namespace used for an IRI as discussed
      previously. It is harvested from the source information if present.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "valueSource" key describes the type's source information for a resource.
      It currently always specifies a constant resource and is discussed in more detail
      later.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>The "valueSource" key container...</h2>
<p>

        "(source key)" : "(source value)"
    },
    ...
</pre>
<p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The "source" key identifies some (source type).  The (source type) corresponds to
      the (source key). The (source type) may be:

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>column</b> - a data column type, use a data column name cell for the

        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>DEPENDENT</b>
      The "(source key)" key identifies the (source value) used for the source. The
      (source key) may be:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>columnName</b> - the (source value) is a data column name use to retreive
          cell values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>constant</b> - the (source value) is a user entered constant used as the
          value.  Constant values result in a singleton value used throughout the
          transform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>expression</b> - <b>(UNUSED)</b> the (source value) is an expression to
          evaluate as the value.  The resulting value may be constant or variable.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>The "valueType" key container...</h2>

    },
    ...
</pre>
<p>
The "valueType" key container elements are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The "type" key identifies some (value type).  The (value type) corresponds to
      the (type key). The (value type) may be:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>iri</b> - an IRI is generated from the source value. In this case, the (type
          key) is not needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>bnode</b> - a variable Blank Node resource is generated from the
          source value. The Blank Node is generated, one per row as needed. In this case,
