  <h2>News</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.0.5 Alpha Released</dt>
    <dd>This version has replaced the RDF4J library with the Jena library resulting in a 2/3rds reduction
        of the release file size. The "controller" initialization code has been rewritten as Java code in
        the InitializationCommand class. Other enhancements include Literal processing corrections, new
        export selections to match the Jena change, code management, log and debug enhancements, and
        website example updates. The version is back to an Alpha state due to the Jena overhaul.</dd>
