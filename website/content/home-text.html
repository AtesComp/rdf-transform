  <!-- RDF Transform Version Control -->
  <h2>News</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.4 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version corrects the Lucene ontology copy process from Global space to a Project and adds
        CSRF protection to exports.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.3 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updates dependencies and fixes the ontology loading process. It also mitigates facet
        processing issues where RDF Transform fails to injects command processing.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.2 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is a minor update for the copyright notice and fixes the arrow start and end images
        removed from the OpenRefine main project.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.1 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updated the LICENSE.txt and adds license text to all revelant project files.
        It also fixes dialog loading issues due to the added license text.
        It fixes browser loading issues due to unnamed static declarations.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.2.0 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updated the Exporters for use with the latest Apache Jena library used by
        OpenRefine. This requires OpenRefine 3.6 or better. The Export menu has been recoded for Stream
        and Pretty formats. The exports have been optimized to process the RDF statements in critical
        sections. Resizing the display tabs have been updated to correctly calculate the initial sizes.
        The Transform tab has been updated for proper Prefix vertical alignment. Export server calls
        have been normalized to use the Jena library RDFFormat names to simplify Command Line use for
        batch processing transforms. Server results returned to the client have been normalized to use
        common code responses. Preview controls have been updated to better select between Stream and
        Pretty mode. Corrections for some outling UTF-8 encoding issues are included. A Japanese
        translation file was added and resulted in an OpenRefine 3.7 update to rename Japanese
        translation files from ".jp" to ".ja". POM file updates have reduced the RDF Transform
        extension file to 8.9 MiB!</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.1.1 Beta Released</dt>
    <dd>This version corrects Literal processing for record-based literals at the Tier 2 level and below.
        Literals not directly connected to a root node would not process properly when in OpenRefine
        "record" mode. These literals would not be present in the preview or in export files. Other
        enhancements include preview controls for setting 1) the sample size for records or rows to
        process and 2) the preview output type based on a Jena Stream or Pretty format, new
        RDFTransform.previewStream preference as default for preview output type, updated the preview
        expression dialog, expanded the exports with Pretty Formats, updated the Lucene version, code
        management, and log and debug enhancements.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.1.0 Beta Released</dt>
    <dd>This version correct the Namespace processing by Web and File Import. The Web Import controls
        faulty content negotiation for the non-existent XMLSchema ontology. The File Import corrects
        the client POST processing for form content including file streams. Other enhancements include
        further corrects for the "controller" initialization code, removing Binary RDF processing and
        adding RDFThrift processing to match the Jena change, an RDFTransform.DebugJSON preference to
        manage the transform template output separate from other debugging, code management, log and
        debug enhancements, and website example updates.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.0.5 Alpha Released</dt>
    <dd>This version has replaced the RDF4J library with the Jena library resulting in a 2/3rds reduction
        of the release file size. The "controller" initialization code has been rewritten as Java code in
        the InitializationCommand class. Other enhancements include Literal processing corrections, new
        export selections to match the Jena change, code management, log and debug enhancements, and
        website example updates. The version is back to an Alpha state due to the Jena overhaul.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.0.4 Beta Released</dt>
