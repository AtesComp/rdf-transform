  <!-- RDF Transform Version Control -->
  <h2>News</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.3.4 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is updates RDF Template import and export processing. The prior extension used
      showOpenFilePicker() exclusively which is not used by some browsers due to topical developer
      differences on undefined, esoteric, local file access security issues. This release provides for
      alternative, classical file processing.
      This release also finished conversion to the new Prefixed Namespace format for processing ontologies
      from URL, file, and "none" sources--the old system had no stored designation from which it loaded
      an ontology so would erroniously default to URL on reload even when "none" where avaiable. This
      resulted is slow startups. A file Prefixed Namespace loads its ontology from locally store files.
      A "none" Prefixed Namespace does not attempt to load an ontology. The namespace processing attempts
      a "best effort" to convert an old namespace format to the new format.
      This release also updates some deprecated jQuery calls.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.3.3 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is updates RDF output format processing. The preview and export processes were
      changed from using a Model to a DatasetGraph to manage statement. This allows for Named Graph
      use (using the BaseIRI). That change wrongly assumed all Jena languages could handle a DatasetGraph.
      A Model is inherently a single Graph manager while a DatasetGraph manages multiple Graphs. A
      language is either Graph-centric (Turtle, NTriple, etc) or DatasetGraphs-centric (TriG, NQuad, etc).
      A Graph-centric language cannot process a DatasetGraph. This release corrects Graph-centric
      languages to use a DatasetGraph's Union Graph.
      This release also corrects reconstruction issues during application and extension loading. RDF
      Transform now uses Jackson explicitly for Operation reconstruction.
      For stream formats, this release collects all statements in an in-memory DatasetGraph for
      organization before export due to redundant statement processing in the prior versions. This
      essentially equates the stream process to the pretty process and results in sub-optimal stream
      processing for large datasets. To mitigate, divide the originating dataset into manageable chunks
      and/or increase the Java engine's memory parameters.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.3.2 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is updates the Namespace management. The Prefix, Namespace, Location, and
      Location Type are store for each Namespace in the project. This expands on the older Prefix
      and Namespace storage. It allows the Namespace management to recall from where it loaded the
      Namespace. For URLs, they may differ from the Namespace IRI. For Files, the uploaded file is
      stored in the RDF Transform cache in a project directory.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.3.1 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is a minor update. The RDF Node dialog is updated with a resizer. Additionally,
      the dialog's left column "Content" resizes with the dialog and adds scrollbars when needed. The
      dialog and related left column Content are initialize to their minimum size when opened. This
      fixes an issue when displaying a long "Content" (column names) lists where the bottom of the list
      was not reachable--it extended down beyond the visible screen. This issue also made the "OK" and
      "Cancel" buttons inaccessible. The dialog also allows widening to better view long column names.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.3.0 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version added the initial Context IRI support for Quad-enabled formats. The Preview screen
        output is changed from Turtle to TriG. Fixed VocabularyImporter to import owl:ObjectProperty and
        owl:DatatypeProperty. Changed hardcodes vocabulary queries to preference values. Added
        CHANGELOG.md file.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.4 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version corrects the Lucene ontology copy process from Global space to a Project and adds
        CSRF protection to exports.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.3 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updates dependencies and fixes the ontology loading process. It also mitigates facet
        processing issues where RDF Transform fails to injects command processing.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.2 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version is a minor update for the copyright notice and fixes the arrow start and end images
        removed from the OpenRefine main project.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.2.1 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updated the LICENSE.txt and adds license text to all revelant project files.
        It also fixes dialog loading issues due to the added license text.
        It fixes browser loading issues due to unnamed static declarations.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.2.0 Released</dt>
    <dd>This version updated the Exporters for use with the latest Apache Jena library used by
        OpenRefine. This requires OpenRefine 3.6 or better. The Export menu has been recoded for Stream
        and Pretty formats. The exports have been optimized to process the RDF statements in critical
        sections. Resizing the display tabs have been updated to correctly calculate the initial sizes.
        The Transform tab has been updated for proper Prefix vertical alignment. Export server calls
        have been normalized to use the Jena library RDFFormat names to simplify Command Line use for
        batch processing transforms. Server results returned to the client have been normalized to use
        common code responses. Preview controls have been updated to better select between Stream and
        Pretty mode. Corrections for some outling UTF-8 encoding issues are included. A Japanese
        translation file was added and resulted in an OpenRefine 3.7 update to rename Japanese
        translation files from ".jp" to ".ja". POM file updates have reduced the RDF Transform
        extension file to 8.9 MiB!</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.1.1 Beta Released</dt>
    <dd>This version corrects Literal processing for record-based literals at the Tier 2 level and below.
        Literals not directly connected to a root node would not process properly when in OpenRefine
        "record" mode. These literals would not be present in the preview or in export files. Other
        enhancements include preview controls for setting 1) the sample size for records or rows to
        process and 2) the preview output type based on a Jena Stream or Pretty format, new
        RDFTransform.previewStream preference as default for preview output type, updated the preview
        expression dialog, expanded the exports with Pretty Formats, updated the Lucene version, code
        management, and log and debug enhancements.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.1.0 Beta Released</dt>
    <dd>This version correct the Namespace processing by Web and File Import. The Web Import controls
        faulty content negotiation for the non-existent XMLSchema ontology. The File Import corrects
        the client POST processing for form content including file streams. Other enhancements include
        further corrects for the "controller" initialization code, removing Binary RDF processing and
        adding RDFThrift processing to match the Jena change, an RDFTransform.debugJSON preference to
        manage the transform template output separate from other debugging, code management, log and
        debug enhancements, and website example updates.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.0.5 Alpha Released</dt>
    <dd>This version has replaced the RDF4J library with the Jena library resulting in a 2/3rds reduction
        of the release file size. The "controller" initialization code has been rewritten as Java code in
        the InitializationCommand class. Other enhancements include Literal processing corrections, new
        export selections to match the Jena change, code management, log and debug enhancements, and
        website example updates. The version is back to an Alpha state due to the Jena overhaul.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>2.0.4 Beta Released</dt>
    <dd>This version includes BaseIRI export checking, UI image changes, code management, log and debug
        enhancements, and website example updates.</dd>
