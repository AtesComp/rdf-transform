<h1>RDF Transform</h1>
<p>
  RDF Transform is an <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> extension that maps project data
  into an RDF representation using a mapping structure (i.e., the "transform") designed by the user.
</p>
<h2>The Transform</h2>
<p>
  The transform has a well defined structure using root nodes (a.k.a., resources, subjects) connecting
  through properties (a special resource describing a context), generally defined by data column names,
  to objects (either another resource or a literal--a typed or untyped string), generally defined by a
  column's cell data.  Then, the mapping decribes a set of triples of the form:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  subject --- property ---> object
</p>
<p>
  where the triple is a simple graph with subject and object nodes connected by a property edge. If an
  object is a resource, then it may also be a subject (or object) in another triple. Then, any given
  subject may also be an object in some other triple.  If an object is a literal, then it represents a
  "leaf" node in a graph and is a data value that (partially) describes a subject.
</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
  Resources are described by the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and include so called "blank
  nodes"--a unnamed node used to hold a connection to other relevent data. Resources must be described
  for "Root Nodes" as they are the primary subjects for a set of triples.
</p>
<p>
  RDF Transform allows a resource object to serve as a subject to other objects by directly adding
  properties to the object. This extends the user dialog "rightward" as new properties and objects are
  added. A far right resource object may be "duplicated" as a root node to assist with some kinds of
  transforms.
</p>
<h3>Root Nodes</h3>
<p>
  An RDF Transform mapping must have at lease one root node. A root node can be thought of as a record
  index or some other similar construct. Project data occasionally have readily defined root node
  elements like a U. S. Social Security number for a person or a VIN for a vehicle.  If not, a reference
  to the given row or record number may be used (however that would not be unique for similar data
  projects that would latter be combined) or a blank node may suffice as they may be universally unique.
  Constant UUIDs in cast in a resource format may also serve this purpose.
</p>
<p>
  A new root node may also be added. Root nodes might be "constant" and, therefore, not bound
  specifically to rows or records.  This also allows for "constant" subjects not connected to any
  project data used to define singleton triples or well-known constant subgraphs.
</p>
<p>
  Deleteing all root nodes is one way to reset a transform to its initial state.
</p>
<h3>Resource Types</h3>
<p>
  Resources may be typed as to belong to (or be an instance of) a class. Therefore, a type feature is
  built into RDF Transform. These are triples just like the others of the form:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  subject --- rdf:type ---> type
</p>
<p>
  where "rdf:type" may also be represented as "a" (as in "is a") in the common Turtle transport format.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
  Properties are the contextual "connective tissue" that bind subjects to their objects. Using a
  database analogy, each field (or column) name in a table can be characterized as a property for a
  table. The key field cell data (the keys) serves as a subject, the other field names serve as
  properties, and the cell data for a property column are objects for the respective subjects. Then, the
  RDF representation is a highly normalized form for a tradiftional RDBMS.  Foreign keys are objects
  used as subjects for the joined table a foreign key represents. Therefore, properties are defined as
  specialied resources used to connect subjects to objects. Properties are free text declarations but
  have suggested elements from the namespaces.  Default properties are auto-generated from the Base IRI
  and the project's column names.
</p>
<h2>Literals</h2>
<p>
  Literals are object elements related to its subject--the property values for a subject. They may
  contain additional datatype information such as "date", "integer", or "boolean" or language
  identifiers such as "en", "it", "es". Some common datatypes are provided. The user may specify any
  "custom" datatype or any acceptable language identifier. Example literals are the weight, length,
  name, color, cost, etc., values of some thing. They may (or may not) have datatypes or language
  decorators directly attached to the literal string.  For example:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  "1.32"^^xsd:double<br />
  "632"^^xsd:integer<br />
  "cat"@en<br />
  "gato"@es<br />
  "some interesting string"
</p>
<p>
  Default literals are auto-generated as objects of the default properties from the project's column
  names.
