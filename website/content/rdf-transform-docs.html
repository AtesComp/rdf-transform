  With the export functionality, you can design the structure of the RDF data by creating an RDF template.
  The exporter iterates through the project rows or records evaluating expressions in the RDF template
  and producing an equivalent RDF subgraph for each row or record. The final result is a single file
  containing all the subgraphs.

<p>
  The image below shows the main parts of a sample RDF Template.

<p class="note">
  Any applied filters on the data affect the exported RDF (i.e., exported RDF data corresponds to the
  current visible rows or records). This feature processes RDF data with any custom subset of the data or
  by using different transforms for different subsets of the data.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Notice that you can define multiple subject resources (i.e., multiple root nodes) as shown in the figure
  above...and delete them if necessary.

  Terms from existing vocabularies can be imported. The vocabulary importer attempts to retrieve and index
  the terms so that they can be included as autocompletion entries available for class and property
  additions. Also, by using a dump from a namespace lookup site, for example
  <a href="http://prefix.cc">prefix.cc</a>, IRIs for popular namespaces are automatically suggested.

  Data can be exported in many different RDF formats using the "Export" menu. All known RDF4J formats are
  available.
