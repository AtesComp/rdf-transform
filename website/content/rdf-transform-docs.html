  With the export functionality, you can determine the intended structure of the RDF data by drawing a
  template graph. The exporter iterates through the project rows evaluating expressions in the template
  graph and producing an equivalent RDF subgraph for each row. The final result is a single file containing
  all the subgraphs.

<p>
The image below shows the main parts of a sample graph template.

<p class="note">
  Any applied filters on the data affect the exported RDF (i.e., RDF data exported corresponds to the
  current visible rows). This feature processes RDF data with any custom subset of the data or by using
  different transforms for different subsets of the data.

<p class="note">
  Notice that you can define multiple subject resources (i.e., multiple root nodes) as shown in the figure
  above.

  Terms from existing vocabularies can be imported. The importer attempts to retrieve and index the terms
  so that they can be included as autocompletion entries available for class and property additions. Also,
  by using a dump from a namespace lookup site, <a href="http://prefix.cc">prefix.cc</a>, IRIs for popular
  prefixes are automatically suggested.

Data can be exported in RDF/XML or Turtle using the "Export" menu.
