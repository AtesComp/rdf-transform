# RDF Transform
![Build Status](https://github.com/AtesComp/rdf-transform/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

## Introduction
This project uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for transforming OpenRefine project data to RDF-based formats. The transform maps the data with a template graph designed using the GUI.

RDF Transform is based on the venerable "RDF Extension" ([grefine-rdf-extension](https://github.com/stkenny/grefine-rdf-extension)). However, it has been thoroughly rewritten to incorporate the newer Java and JavaScript technologies, techniques, and processing enhancements.
